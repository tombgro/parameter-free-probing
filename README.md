# parameter-free-probing

This repository includes code used in the paper: "What Does Parameter-free Probing Really Uncover?" (to appear in ACL)

The repositories "dependency" and "utils" are taken from the [original code by Wu et al. (2020)](https://github.com/LividWo/Perturbed-Masking)

The folder "results" contains the results from which the BERT-derived parses are computer. This was obtained by replicating Wu et al.'s (2020) experiments as explained in their codebase.

The file read_dep_matrix.py contains functions for reading BERT-parses and comparing them to Universal Dependency (UD) annotations.
